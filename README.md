The goal of this assignment was to learn the basic operations and functions of python commands. There were 22 different command operations that each wanted us to write a line of code that would solve the function it provided. Throughtout this assignment, I learned (though very briefly) how to convert variables into integers, floats, strings. In addition, I also learned the basics for lists, slicing, and creating a random number generator.
